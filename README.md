What does Compilation mean in Programming?

The C language is an exemple of a Compilated language and i will briefly demonstrate in this project i will show how works a compiler in a C language and how to invocate the compiler collection to have the result of this operation.

Simply, the compilation means to transform a program written in a high-level programming language from source code into low level programming language (Binary). Programmers write programs in a form called source code.

To introduce the subject , let’s start with example to explain quickly the Low level programming language:
The zeros and ones used in binary code represent open (zero) or closed (one) electrical signals. Rather than using a decimal system like what we do (which goes from 1 to 9 and starts again by adding a 0 to go to 10), the binary goes from 0 to 1 and then starts again at 10.11 then 100, 101, 110…

For computers , a file means “electrical signals” composed by octet ,byte
