Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing

Write a blog post describing the differences between static and dynamic libraries. It should cover:

    Why using libraries in general
    How do they work
    How to create them (Linux only)
    How to use them (Linux only)
    What are the differences between static and dynamic libraries
    What are the advantages and drawbacks of each of them
